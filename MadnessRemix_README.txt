PLEASE, PLEASE, AND I MEAN PRETTY PLEASE, READ THIS MANUAL CAREFULLY TO PROPERLY INSTALL THE MOD! I
AM NOT, AND WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IF YOU SOMEHOW DAMAGE YOUR AMNESIA: THE DARK DESCENT INSTALL
JUST BY INSTALLING THIS MOD.

Madness Remix is a Custom Story-Full Conversion hybrid mod, meaning you can play this mod in two
different ways all while utilizing data from the same folder.

If you want to play Madness Remix as a Full Conversion mod, go to your Amnesia folder, then to
custom_stories, then to MadnessRemix, and click on either MadnessRemix.bat (applicable for all/any
storefront versions) or MadnessRemix_NoSteam.bat (if you want to play Madness Remix without Steam
integration).
